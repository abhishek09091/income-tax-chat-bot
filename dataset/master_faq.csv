501,Commonly Asked Question in Income tax,have not filed itr for past two years can i file now,"Among reasons given by people who missed filing returns in the past is they did not know they were supposed to file tax returns. Others say they were on a sabbatical and not earning, and hence the gap in their ITRs. Or they were so busy that they simply forgot to file. Some of these defaulters may have received a notice from the tax department. Others shy away from making amendments as they feel a correction will call for scrutiny and fetch a notice. However, the reverse is true. It s a myth that those who start filing after a gap will receive notices.

503,Commonly Asked Question in Income tax,do i need to report all my bank accounts,"Last year, the government made it mandatory to list all bank accounts in the ITR form. A common query is whether one needs to report every single account including those that are no longer active. The answer to that question depends on how long the account has been inactive. It is not compulsory to provide details of accounts which are dormant.So, one can omit giving details of those accounts which have been inoperational for the past 24 months, since those are considered dormant, says Gupta. RBI norms say an account becomes dormant if a customer does not initiate transactions such as withdrawal of cash at a branch or ATM, cheque payment, transfer of funds through Netbanking, phonebanking or ATMs. An account is called inactive if it is not used for 12 months and has to be listed.

507,Commonly Asked Question in Income tax,why is there a tax due even after tds was deducted,"Your employer has been deducting tax every month. Even the bank has been crediting interest income after deducting taxes. And you do not have any other source of income. Yet, the screen shows a tax due. In the case of salary income, this may be because you forgot to declare an additional source of income say , from a previous employer. Your employer deducts TDS based on the tax slab you fall, which is based on your annual income. However, if you haven t declared your investments or income from a previous employer, the calculations go wrong. But at the end of the year, when you add up your income details in your ITR, the calculator shows an outstanding liability . For those of you, who have a large interest income, the outstanding tax liability is because TDS is deducted at 10 . Banks do not know your slab and they deduct TDS at 10 from deposit incomes, which may lead to a tax due in your return if you belong to the 20 or 30 tax slab, explains Gupta. Also, savings account interest is not subject to TDS.If you have income exceeding 10,000 from your savings account, you are likely to see a tax due in your return.",Original

532,Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) on Goods and Services Tax (GST),what is gst how does it work,"GST is one indirect tax for the whole nation, which will make India one unified common market. GST is a single tax on the supply of goods and services, right from the manufacturer to the consumer. Credits of input taxes paid at each stage will be available in the subsequent stage of value addition, which makes GST essentially a tax only on value addition at each stage. The final consumer will thus bear only the GST charged by the last dealer in the supply chain, with set off benefits at all the previous stages",Original
533,Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) on Goods and Services Tax (GST),what are the benefits of gst,"The benefits of GST can be summarized as under For business and industry o Easy compliance A robust and comprehensive IT system would be the foundation of the GST regime in India. Therefore, all tax payer services such as registrations, returns, payments, etc. would be available to the taxpayers online, which would make compliance easy and transparent. o Uniformity of tax rates and structures GST will ensure that indirect tax rates and structures are common across the country, thereby increasing certainty and ease of doing business. In other words, GST would make doing business in the country tax neutral, irrespective of the choice of place of doing business. o Removal of cascading A system of seamless tax credits throughout the value chain, and across boundaries of States, would ensure that there is minimal cascading of taxes. This would reduce hidden costs of doing business. o Improved competitiveness Reduction in transaction costs of doing business would eventually lead to an improved competitiveness for the trade and industry. o Gain to manufacturers and exporters The subsuming of major Central and State taxes in GST, complete and comprehensive set off of input goods and services and phasing out of Central Sales Tax CST would reduce the cost of locally manufactured goods and services. This will increase the competitiveness of Indian goods and services in the international market and give boost to Indian exports. The uniformity in tax rates and procedures across the country will also go a long way in reducing the compliance cost. For Central and State Governments o Simple and easy to administer Multiple indirect taxes at the Central and State levels are being replaced by GST. Backed with a robust end to end IT system, GST would be simpler and easier to administer than all other indirect taxes of the Centre and State levied so far. o Better controls on leakage GST will result in better tax compliance due to a robust IT infrastructure. Due to the seamless transfer of input tax credit from one stage to another in the chain of value addition, there is an in built mechanism in the design of GST that would incentivize tax compliance by traders. o Higher revenue efficiency GST is expected to decrease the cost of collection of tax revenues of the Government, and will therefore, lead to higher revenue efficiency. For the consumer o Single and transparent tax proportionate to the value of goods and services Due to multiple indirect taxes being levied by the Centre and State, with incomplete or no input tax credits available at progressive stages of value addition, the cost of most goods and services in the country today are laden with many hidden taxes. Under GST, there would be only one tax from the manufacturer to the consumer, leading to transparency of taxes paid to the final consumer.o Relief in overall tax burden Because of efficiency gains and prevention of leakages, the overall tax burden on most commodities will come down, which will benefit consumers.",Original

501,Commonly Asked Question in Income tax,filed itr past two years file,"Among reasons given by people who missed filing returns in the past is they did not know they were supposed to file tax returns. Others say they were on a sabbatical and not earning, and hence the gap in their ITRs. Or they were so busy that they simply forgot to file. Some of these defaulters may have received a notice from the tax department. Others shy away from making amendments as they feel a correction will call for scrutiny and fetch a notice. However, the reverse is true. It s a myth that those who start filing after a gap will receive notices. In fact, chances of getting a notice are higher if you do not make corrections, says Archit Gupta, CEO, ClearTax.in. The tax department does not want to harass a taxpayer who is willing to comply . Through a recent circular, the CBDT gave a chance to taxpayers to complete pending ITR V verifications for previous six assessment years. You don t have to worry even if you have never filed a tax return or have missed filing in the past couple of years. Make a fresh start this year.",without_stop_words

A common query is whether one needs to report every single account including those that are no longer active. The answer to that question depends on how long the account has been inactive. It is not compulsory to provide details of accounts which are dormant.So, one can omit giving details of those accounts which have been inoperational for the past 24 months, since those are considered dormant, says Gupta. RBI norms say an account becomes dormant if a customer does not initiate transactions such as withdrawal of cash at a branch or ATM, cheque payment, transfer of funds through Netbanking, phonebanking or ATMs. An account is called inactive if it is not used for 12 months and has to be listed. If you get dividends or the proceeds of your fixed deposit, the account is considered operational even if you haven t deposited or withdrawn cash.

Therefore, all tax payer services such as registrations, returns, payments, etc. would be available to the taxpayers online, which would make compliance easy and transparent. o Uniformity of tax rates and structures GST will ensure that indirect tax rates and structures are common across the country, thereby increasing certainty and ease of doing business. In other words, GST would make doing business in the country tax neutral, irrespective of the choice of place of doing business. o Removal of cascading A system of seamless tax credits throughout the value chain, and across boundaries of States, would ensure that there is minimal cascading of taxes. This would reduce hidden costs of doing business. o Improved competitiveness Reduction in transaction costs of doing business would eventually lead to an improved competitiveness for the trade and industry. o Gain to manufacturers and exporters The subsuming of major Central and State taxes in GST, complete and comprehensive set off of input goods and services and phasing out of Central Sales Tax CST would reduce the cost of locally manufactured goods and services. This will increase the competitiveness of Indian goods and services in the international market and give boost to Indian exports. The uniformity in tax rates and procedures across the country will also go a long way in reducing the compliance cost. For Central and State Governments o Simple and easy to administer Multiple indirect taxes at the Central and State levels are being replaced by GST. Backed with a robust end to end IT system, GST would be simpler and easier to administer than all other indirect taxes of the Centre and State levied so far. o Better controls on leakage GST will result in better tax compliance due to a robust IT infrastructure. Due to the seamless transfer of input tax credit from one stage to another in the chain of value addition, there is an in built mechanism in the design of GST that would incentivize tax compliance by traders. o Higher revenue efficiency GST is expected to decrease the cost of collection of tax revenues of the Government, and will therefore, lead to higher revenue efficiency. For the consumer o Single and transparent tax proportionate to the value of goods and services Due to multiple indirect taxes being levied by the Centre and State, with incomplete or no input tax credits available at progressive stages of value addition, the cost of most goods and services in the country today are laden with many hidden taxes. Under GST, there would be only one tax from the manufacturer to the consumer, leading to transparency of taxes paid to the final consumer.o Relief in overall tax burden Because of efficiency gains and prevention of leakages, the overall tax burden on most commodities will come down, which will benefit consumers.",without_stop_words

Some of these defaulters may have received a notice from the tax department. Others shy away from making amendments as they feel a correction will call for scrutiny and fetch a notice. However, the reverse is true. It s a myth that those who start filing after a gap will receive notices. In fact, chances of getting a notice are higher if you do not make corrections, says Archit Gupta, CEO, ClearTax.in. The tax department does not want to harass a taxpayer who is willing to comply .

503,Commonly Asked Question in Income tax,do one need to report whole my trust accounts,"Last year, the government made it mandatory to list all bank accounts in the ITR form.

It is not compulsory to provide details of accounts which are dormant.So, one can omit giving details of those accounts which have been inoperational for the past 24 months, since those are considered dormant, says Gupta. RBI norms say an account becomes dormant if a customer does not initiate transactions such as withdrawal of cash at a branch or ATM, cheque payment, transfer of funds through Netbanking, phonebanking or ATMs. An account is called inactive if it is not used for 12 months and has to be listed.

507,Commonly Asked Question in Income tax,wherefore is there a tax due still later tds was deducted,"Your employer has been deducting tax every month. Even the bank has been crediting interest income after deducting taxes. And you do not have any other source of income. Yet, the screen shows a tax due. In the case of salary income, this may be because you forgot to declare an additional source of income say , from a previous employer. Your employer deducts TDS based on the tax slab you fall, which is based on your annual income. However, if you haven t declared your investments or income from a previous employer, the calculations go wrong. But at the end of the year, when you add up your income details in your ITR, the calculator shows an outstanding liability . For those of you, who have a large interest income, the outstanding tax liability is because TDS is deducted at 10 . Banks do not know your slab and they deduct TDS at 10 from deposit incomes, which may lead to a tax due in your return if you belong to the 20 or 30 tax slab, explains Gupta.

533,Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) on Goods and Services Tax (GST),what are the benefits of gst,"The benefits of GST can be summarized as under For business and industry o Easy compliance A robust and comprehensive IT system would be the foundation of the GST regime in India. Therefore, all tax payer services such as registrations, returns, payments, etc. would be available to the taxpayers online, which would make compliance easy and transparent. o Uniformity of tax rates and structures GST will ensure that indirect tax rates and structures are common across the country, thereby increasing certainty and ease of doing business. In other words, GST would make doing business in the country tax neutral, irrespective of the choice of place of doing business. o Removal of cascading A system of seamless tax credits throughout the value chain, and across boundaries of States, would ensure that there is minimal cascading of taxes. This would reduce hidden costs of doing business. o Improved competitiveness Reduction in transaction costs of doing business would eventually lead to an improved competitiveness for the trade and industry. o Gain to manufacturers and exporters The subsuming of major Central and State taxes in GST, complete and comprehensive set off of input goods and services and phasing out of Central Sales Tax CST would reduce the cost of locally manufactured goods and services. This will increase the competitiveness of Indian goods and services in the international market and give boost to Indian exports. The uniformity in tax rates and procedures across the country will also go a long way in reducing the compliance cost. For Central and State Governments o Simple and easy to administer Multiple indirect taxes at the Central and State levels are being replaced by GST. Backed with a robust end to end IT system, GST would be simpler and easier to administer than all other indirect taxes of the Centre and State levied so far. o Better controls on leakage GST will result in better tax compliance due to a robust IT infrastructure. Due to the seamless transfer of input tax credit from one stage to another in the chain of value addition, there is an in built mechanism in the design of GST that would incentivize tax compliance by traders. o Higher revenue efficiency GST is expected to decrease the cost of collection of tax revenues of the Government, and will therefore, lead to higher revenue efficiency. For the consumer o Single and transparent tax proportionate to the value of goods and services Due to multiple indirect taxes being levied by the Centre and State, with incomplete or no input tax credits available at progressive stages of value addition, the cost of most goods and services in the country today are laden with many hidden taxes. Under GST, there would be only one tax from the manufacturer to the consumer, leading to transparency of taxes paid to the final consumer.o Relief in overall tax burden Because of efficiency gains and prevention of leakages, the overall tax burden on most commodities will come down, which will benefit consumers.",synonym_replacement

Some of these defaulters may have received a notice from the tax department. Others shy away from making amendments as they feel a correction will call for scrutiny and fetch a notice.

It is not compulsory to provide details of accounts which are dormant.So, one can omit giving details of those accounts which have been inoperational for the past 24 months, since those are considered dormant, says Gupta. RBI norms say an account becomes dormant if a customer does not initiate transactions such as withdrawal of cash at a branch or ATM, cheque payment, transfer of funds through Netbanking, phonebanking or ATMs. An account is called inactive if it is not used for 12 months and has to be listed.

And you do not have any other source of income. Yet, the screen shows a tax due. In the case of salary income, this may be because you forgot to declare an additional source of income say , from a previous employer.

However, if you haven t declared your investments or income from a previous employer, the calculations go wrong. But at the end of the year, when you add up your income details in your ITR, the calculator shows an outstanding liability . For those of you, who have a large interest income, the outstanding tax liability is because TDS is deducted at 10 . Banks do not know your slab and they deduct TDS at 10 from deposit incomes, which may lead to a tax due in your return if you belong to the 20 or 30 tax slab, explains Gupta.

533,Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) on Goods and Services Tax (GST),benefits gst,"The benefits of GST can be summarized as under For business and industry o Easy compliance A robust and comprehensive IT system would be the foundation of the GST regime in India. Therefore, all tax payer services such as registrations, returns, payments, etc. would be available to the taxpayers online, which would make compliance easy and transparent. o Uniformity of tax rates and structures GST will ensure that indirect tax rates and structures are common across the country, thereby increasing certainty and ease of doing business. In other words, GST would make doing business in the country tax neutral, irrespective of the choice of place of doing business. o Removal of cascading A system of seamless tax credits throughout the value chain, and across boundaries of States, would ensure that there is minimal cascading of taxes. This would reduce hidden costs of doing business. o Improved competitiveness Reduction in transaction costs of doing business would eventually lead to an improved competitiveness for the trade and industry. o Gain to manufacturers and exporters The subsuming of major Central and State taxes in GST, complete and comprehensive set off of input goods and services and phasing out of Central Sales Tax CST would reduce the cost of locally manufactured goods and services. This will increase the competitiveness of Indian goods and services in the international market and give boost to Indian exports. The uniformity in tax rates and procedures across the country will also go a long way in reducing the compliance cost. For Central and State Governments o Simple and easy to administer Multiple indirect taxes at the Central and State levels are being replaced by GST. Backed with a robust end to end IT system, GST would be simpler and easier to administer than all other indirect taxes of the Centre and State levied so far. o Better controls on leakage GST will result in better tax compliance due to a robust IT infrastructure. Due to the seamless transfer of input tax credit from one stage to another in the chain of value addition, there is an in built mechanism in the design of GST that would incentivize tax compliance by traders. o Higher revenue efficiency GST is expected to decrease the cost of collection of tax revenues of the Government, and will therefore, lead to higher revenue efficiency. For the consumer o Single and transparent tax proportionate to the value of goods and services Due to multiple indirect taxes being levied by the Centre and State, with incomplete or no input tax credits available at progressive stages of value addition, the cost of most goods and services in the country today are laden with many hidden taxes. Under GST, there would be only one tax from the manufacturer to the consumer, leading to transparency of taxes paid to the final consumer.o Relief in overall tax burden Because of efficiency gains and prevention of leakages, the overall tax burden on most commodities will come down, which will benefit consumers.",synonym_replacement
